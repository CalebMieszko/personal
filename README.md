# projects
School and personal projects of mine - mostly completed, a few incomplete!

This is a compilation of different public projects I have worked on or am working on right now. If you're taking CS50 at Harvard, and haven't already turned in your work and had it graded - DO NOT look at anything here - you might shoot yourself in the foot, because that's where a lot of these projects came from.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me at caleb.mieszko@gmail.com and I'll be happy to get in touch!
